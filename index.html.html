	<p> My name is Harpreet but can call me Harry ( probably easy to pronounce ) and I am highly passionate about the latest cars and automobiles that are based on the use of effective technology. The Sport cars are attractive not only in terms of look that they present but are also built with latest technology that provides speed and fun to ride. My passion has grown with the increased use of latest technology in manufacturing of sports car to provide an extraordinary experience. The sports cars are highly expensive and are not affordable by all and provide an exclusive experience of drive. The use of aerodynamic sleek style allows higher appeal and speed of the car. The exceptional features of the sports car make it attractive and interesting to me.</p>

  <h3> Myers - Brigs Type Indicator </h3>
  <p> The test through the Myers type Indicator has provided with my areas of strength that includes deep research to determine the facts of an event and gaining underrating before taking action. The weakness that the test presents is the lack of patience and getting easily upset with an improper idea implementation. I still have opportunity of handling complicated task through communication efficiency while working in teams. I need to prioritize my activities otherwise it will impose threat of incomplete activities. I am a more detailed oriented personality and can work for long hours alone to achieve my aim. I have an approach that includes maximum care and methodology so that efforts are directed towards achievement in minimum time. </p>

  <h3> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
  <p> The test result states that I am hardworking personality that needs to work upon my communication and team working skills to ensure that all the prioritized activities are completed with patience. I need to work more hard to survive the ongoing competition in the field of technological innovation to built sports car that drives people comfort. </p>

  <h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
  <p> The results will ensure that I think twice and act more patiently when handling critical situation in team work. I will be able to ensure that I am actively engaged in motivation of team members to deal with complex research task. The test has also provided with deep insight about an effective leader and its role in managing positive behaviour and outcome. </p>

  <h3> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
  <p> The role of an effective leader is highly critical in managing positive behaviour among employees. In the process of team formation, the skill of each individual and the behaviour needs to be identified so that teams are formed that allows maximum coordination. The theory of Belbin and Tuckman needs to be addressed in team formation so that a positive direction can be ensured. Team formation is an ideal method of ensuring coordination at work and managing conflicts through improved methods so that objectives are achieved. Team formation must involve identifying skill of each individual and grouping them in similar teams that allow enhancing skills.  </p>

  <h1> Project Idea </h1>
  </div>
  

<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p> The project plan is to develop a Raspberry Pi technology that can be installed in the sports car so that the one driving the car have a comfortable journey by easy diagnosis that gets started with just order of mouth. This will provide the experience of undisturbed driving and comfort with use of new technology. The project needs to be completed with proper market research and understanding the underlying cost structure for development and implementation of software. The feasibility of the project is considered to be 5 years tenure and the aim is to provide an experience to the owners that allow long term trust with sports car. The technology will allow getting work done easily without much movement and pressure to the body and watching favourite shows. The high class people find this luxury in the car and are ready to pay the huge cost associated with such cars  </p> 

<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p> The growth of demand for automobiles has grown with the inception of sports car that provides luxurious experience to the customers. The high status customers do not find it difficult or hard to pay the huge bill of the car as they get luxury while travelling. There are around 1.5 billion car owners in Australia and 90% of the population are interested in buying luxurious cars that provide them with high performance and luxury. The people are car enthusiastic and excited in buying luxurious vehicles that suits their status. The use of Raspberry Pi will increase the comfort of the customers that is associated with these luxury cars and is available with high feasibility in terms of cost and installation. This is one of the most effective solutions to this problem. It displays all car diagnostics easily (About Sports car overview, 2019).  </p>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p> The Raspberry Pi technology to be used in the sports car will provide convenience to drivers through detection of traffic lights, pedestrian detection, vehicle and road sign detection so that cars can be made highly autonomous. It is inbuilt with a machine learning technology ad sensor that detects these and provides intimation to the driver through sounds so that control can be named better during situations of high speed. These are highly active and reliable technology that provides first hand information for better experience while driving. There is a camera that is located at the port of the car that foresees things for information to the one driving. This technology can also be used in the highly automated cars without drivers. It acts like a central processing unit in the car that provides right direction like a video streaming. The camera allows detecting the various parameters while driving the car (Raspberry Pi technology in car, 2019). 
The technology is designed to even notice and alert about the small parameters that comes on the way while car driving on the road. The highly reliable technology is safe and allows safe driving with less prone to accidents. The cars can be made more autonomous and safety level can be increased while driving. </p>

<h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
<p> The hardware required in the installation of this latest technology in cars includes a USB Micro power supply which looks like a standard charger of mobile phone. An 8 GB class SD card of total quantity of 4pc is also needed for the installation of system. It also requires an Ethernet to ensure connectivity in the car and a memory card reader is installed in the system for processing of information. A good quality of power supply is ensured in the cars through proper use of cables to manage comfort and reliability of functions of the device. The software required for the installation of Raspberry Pi includes IP scanner, IOT platform and EdgeX package. The deployment of these hardware and software provides proper functioning of the Raspberry Pi in the cars to manage high level of comfort and luxury among the purchasers  </p>

<h3> Skills required </h3>
<p> There is a requirement of all the skill necessary in the development of hardware so that efficiency is optimum. Knowledge of all the wires and cables to manage connectivity is vital in the establishing of software. The ability of coding of software for proper functioning plays a vital role in managing activities of software development. A knowledge of using cloud based services such as IoT is also essential in the managing the new software installation. The installation of Raspberry Pi is highly feasible as it involves easy setting up and cost efficiency. The deployment of necessary resources is a complex activity </p>

<h3> Outcome </h3>
<p> The project has been achieved successfully with deployment of necessary resources. The major complexity was in finding the most authenticated and skilled officials that are trained in using the latest technological gadgets. The main issue faced in the project activity includes the understanding of requirement and its testing so that reliability can be ensured. The recruitment of experts and skilled professionals was a costly task but finally the project activity has been successfully achieved</p>
